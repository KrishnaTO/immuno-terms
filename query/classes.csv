IMM:0000042,MHC III,
IMM:0000001,inhibitor,attenuate inductive signals and further indicate that these receptors play a very important regulatory role in biology.
IMM:0000061,naive T cell,
IMM:0000013,CAR-T cell,
IMM:0000066,tumor specific MHC I,
IMM:0000036,PD-L1,"A protein that acts as a kind of “brake” to keep the body’s immune responses under control. PD-L1 may be found on some normal cells and in higher-than-normal amounts on some types of cancer cells. When PD-L1 binds to another protein called PD-1 (a protein found on T cells), it keeps T cells from killing the PD-L1-containing cells, including the cancer cells. Anticancer drugs called immune checkpoint inhibitors bind to PD-L1 and block its binding to PD-1. This releases the “brakes” on the immune system and leaves T cells free to kill cancer cells."
IMM:0000049,therapy,
IMM:0000056,virus therapy,
IMM:0000025,cell surface,
IMM:0000035,ligand,"A molecule that binds to another molecule, used especially to refer to a small molecule that binds specifically to a larger molecule"
IMM:0000004,tumor microenvironment,"The composition of the tumor microenvironment varies between tumor types, but hallmark features include immune cells, stromal cells, blood vessels, and extracellular matrix."
IMM:0000011,dendritic cell,
IMM:0000047,PD-1,"A protein found on T cells (a type of immune cell) that helps keep the body’s immune responses in check. When PD-1 is bound to another protein called PD-L1, it helps keep T cells from killing other cells, including cancer cells. Some anticancer drugs, called immune checkpoint inhibitors, are used to block PD-1. When this protein is blocked, the “brakes” on the immune system are released and the ability of T cells to kill cancer cells is increased."
IMM:0000040,MHC I,expressed on all nucleated cells and platelets (except those of the central nervous system)
IMM:0000059,regulatory T cell,A lymphocyte which actively suppress the function of conventional T cells as a key mechanism by which the immune system limits inappropriate or excessive responses.
